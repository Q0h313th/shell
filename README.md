## SHELL

* It's a work in progress.
* Im trying to make it super secure, hence all the gcc flags
* I do talk to myself in the comments.
* I know it looks eerily similar to that one tutorial, because it is. Im trying to write it in my way but somehow always come to the conclusion that its done better their way. However, I plan on make it different as I continue writing.
